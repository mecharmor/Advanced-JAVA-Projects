I managed to use resolveAddress to resolve all the addresses in a single pass. This was accomplished by populating a HashMap (during the for each loop) that 
verifies that the current ByteCode needs to be resolved and attempts to resolve it using the incomplete HashMap. If it fails then that ByteCode gets
pushed to the stack to be resolved later. This process repeats but the efficient aspect of it is the actual usage of the incomplete HashMap while looping. 
This decreases the amount of popping that needs to happen after the first pass is complete.
